#First playthrough
You must be the new group of experts that Mr XXX has hired. Welcome to Ventaplex!
You've been selected to help us tackle a very important issue, one that threatens the very foundations of the Ventaplex business.
Patch notes.
We have the developers. We have the software. We have a criminally underpaid, mismanaged and dedicated staff putting the best of the best on the Ventaplex store.
But we don't have any patch notes.
Our customers are very rightly, and very loudly, mocking the software on our store for not disclosing what is actually changing in each patch, which is where you come in.
Only a talented group of experts like yourselves can get to the bottom of it.
Now off you go - there's thousands of patch notes that need to be written. And remember to take your job seriously!

#Subsequent playthroughs (Pick one from A, B and C)

#A
Glad to see you back! That's makes you a member of a very exclusive club, you know!
Oh finally, I thought you'd never show up.
There you are. We've been looking everywhere for you.
Well look what the cat dragged in.
I know where you've been, and it wasn't at your desk working for no pay like the rest of us.

#B (only mention 'patch notes' here to save repetition)
There's plenty more patch notes that need to be written before we can get these updates on the Ventaplex store.
Software updates stop for no one, and the people need their patch notes.
We're at patch note breaking point, we can't take it much longer.
We're so backed up with unwritten patch notes that our systems are about to burst.
We started emailing developers to write their own patch notes but no one ever gets back to us.

#C
Get a move on, time's a wastin'.
So get out there and write us some. Expertly.
There's no time to waste!
This is seriously a matter of life and death.
The fate of the Ventaplex store is on your expert shoulders.

That's a wrap. Three more patches can finally be enjoyed correctly.
And that's that. Congratulations to us all! 
A hard day of work over. Please come back tomorrow.
